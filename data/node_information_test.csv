1001,2000,compactification geometry and duality,Paul S. Aspinwall,,these are notes based on lectures given at tasi99 we review the geometry of the moduli space of n 2 theories in four dimensions from the point of view of superstring compactification the cases of a type iia or type iib string compactified on a calabi-yau threefold and the heterotic string compactified on k3xt2 are each considered in detail we pay specific attention to the differences between n 2 theories and n 2 theories the moduli spaces of vector multiplets and the moduli spaces of hypermultiplets are reviewed in the case of hypermultiplets this review is limited by the poor state of our current understanding some peculiarities such as mixed instantons and the non-existence of a universal hypermultiplet are discussed
1002,2000,domain walls and massive gauged supergravity potentials,"M. Cvetic, H. Lu, C.N. Pope",Class.Quant.Grav.,we point out that massive gauged supergravity potentials for example those arising due to the massive breathing mode of sphere reductions in m-theory or string theory allow for supersymmetric static domain wall solutions which are a hybrid of a randall-sundrum domain wall on one side and a dilatonic domain wall with a run-away dilaton on the other side on the anti-de sitter ads side these walls have a repulsive gravity with an asymptotic region corresponding to the cauchy horizon while on the other side the runaway dilaton approaches the weak coupling regime and a non-singular attractive gravity with the asymptotic region corresponding to the boundary of spacetime we contrast these results with the situation for gauged supergravity potentials for massless scalar modes whose supersymmetric ads extrema are generically maxima and there the asymptotic regime transverse to the wall corresponds to the boundary of the ads spacetime we also comment on the possibility that the massive breathing mode may in the case of fundamental domain-wall sources stabilize such walls via a goldberger-wise mechanism
1003,2000,comment on metric fluctuations in brane worlds,"Y.S. Myung, Gungwon Kang",,recently ivanov and volovich hep-th 9912242 claimed that the perturbation of h mu nu with nonvanishing transverse components h 5 mu is not localized on the brane because h mu nu depends on the fifth coordinate z linearly consequently it may indicate that the effective theory is unstable however we point out that such linear dependence on z can be it gauged away hence the solution does not belong to the physical one therefore even if one includes h 5 mu randall and sundrum's argument for the localized gravity on the brane remains correct
1004,2000,moving mirrors and thermodynamic paradoxes,Adam D. Helfer,Phys.Rev.,quantum fields responding to moving mirrors have been predicted to give rise to thermodynamic paradoxes i show that the assumption in such work that the mirror can be treated as an external field is invalid the exotic energy-transfer effects necessary to the paradoxes are well below the scales at which the model is credible for a first-quantized point-particle mirror it appears that exotic energy-transfers are lost in the quantum uncertainty in the mirror's state an accurate accounting of these energies will require a model which recognizes the mirror's finite reflectivity and almost certainly a model which allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes that is a second-quantized model
1005,2000,bundles of chiral blocks and boundary conditions in cft,"J. Fuchs, C.

1007,2000,topological defects in 3-d euclidean gravity,"Sheng Li, Yong Zhang, Zhongyuan Zhu",,by making use of the complete decomposition of so 3 spin connection the topological defect in 3-dimensional euclidean gravity is studied in detail the topological structure of disclination is given as the combination of a monopole structure and a vortex structure furthermore the kac-moody algebra generated by the monopole and vortex is discussed in three dimensional chern-simons theory
1008,2000,n 0 supersymmetry and the non-relativistic monopole,Donald Spector,Phys.Lett.,we study some of the algebraic properties of the non-relativistic monopole we find that we can construct theories that possess an exotic conserved fermionic charge that squares to the casimir of the rotation group yet do not possess an ordinary supersymmetry this is in contrast to previous known examples with such exotic fermionic charges we proceed to show that the presence of the exotic fermionic charge in the non-supersymmetric theory can nonetheless be understood using supersymmetric techniques providing yet another example of the usefulness of supersymmetry in understanding non-supersymmetric theories
1009,2000,gluon pair production from space-time dependent chromofield,"Gouranga C. Nayak, Walter Greiner",,we compute the probabilty for the processes a q bar q gg via vacuum polarization in the presence of a classical space-time dependent non-abelian field a by applying the background field method of qcd the processes we consider are leading order in ga and are simillar to a e e in qed gluons are treated like a matter field and gauge transformations of the quantum gluonic field are different from those of the classical chromofield to obtain the correct physical polarization of gluons we deduct the corresponding ghost contributions we find that the expression for the probability of the leading order process a gg is transverse with respect to the momentum of the field we observe that the contributions from higher order processes to gluon pair production need to be added to the this leading order process our result presented here is a part of the expression for the total probability for gluon pair production from a space-time dependent chromfield the result for q bar q pair production is similar to that of the e e pair production in qed quark and gluon production from a space-time dependent chromofield will play an important role in the study of the production and equilibration of the quark-gluon plasma in ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions

1011,2000,noncommutativities of d-branes and theta changing degrees of freedom,Tsunehide Kuroki,Phys.Lett.,in d-brane matrix models improved it is known that when there are several d-branes their space-time coordinates in general become noncommutative from the point of view of noncommutative geometry it reflects noncommutativity of the world volume of the d-branes on the other hand as we showed in the previous work in the presence of the constant antisymmetric tensor field the momentum operators of the d-branes have noncommutative structure in the present paper we investigate a relation between these noncommutativities and the description of d-branes in terms of the noncommutative yang-mills theory recently proposed by seiberg and witten it is shown that the noncommutativity of the yang-mills theory which implies that of the world volume coordinates originates from both noncommutativities of the transverse coordinates and momenta from the viewpoint of the lower-dimensional d-branes moreover we show that this noncommutativity is transformed by coordinate transformations on the world volume and thereby can be chosen in an arbitrary fixed value we also make a brief comment on a relation between this fact and a hidden symmetry of the iib matrix models

1014,2000,gauge theories in local causal perturbation theory,Franz-Marc Boas,,in this thesis quantum gauge theories are considered in the framework of local causal perturbation theory gauge invariance is described in terms of the brs formalism local interacting field operators are constructed perturbatively and field equations are established a nilpotent brs transformation is defined on the local algebra of fields it allows the definition of the algebra of local observables as an operator cohomology this algebra of local observables can be represented in a hilbert space the interacting field operators are defined in terms of time ordered products of free field operators for the results above to hold the time ordered products must satisfy certain normalization conditions to formulate these conditions also for field operators that contain a spacetime derivative a suitable mathematical description of time ordered products is developed among the normalization conditions are ward identities for the ghost current and the brs current the latter are generalizations of a normalization condition that is postulated by d utsch hurth krahe and scharf for yang-mills theory it is not yet proven that this condition has a solution in every order all other normalization conditions can be accomplished simultaneously a principle for the correspondence between interacting quantum fields and interacting classical fields is established quantum electrodynamics and yang-mills theory are examined and the results are compared with the literature
